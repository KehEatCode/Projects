# ML project procedure

- Importing the necessary libraries and overview the datasets

    - Importing the dataset

    - View the first and last 5 rows of the dataset

    - Understand the shape of the dataset (how many rows and how many columns)

    - Check the data types of the columns for the dataset

    - Check the missing values in the dataset
    
- Exploratory data analysis

    - Check the statistical summary of dataset
    
    - check the count of each unique category in each of the categorical variables
    
- Univariate analysis

    - Plot
    
- Bivariate analysis

    - Plot
    
- Data preprocessing

    - Feacture engineering
    
    - Outlier check
    
    - Data preparation for modeling
    
    - Check for multicollinearity
    
- Building models

    - model performance on the test and train data
    
    - create the model 1
    
    - get the model 1 summary 
    
    - checking model 1 performance
    
- Drop insignificant variables 
    
    - Create the model 2
    
    - Get the model summary 
    
    - Checking model 2 performance
    
    - checking the linear regression assumptions
    
        - mean of residuals should be zero
        
        - no heteroscedasticity
        
        - linearity of variables
        
        - normality of error terms
        
- Apply cross validation to improve the model and evaluate it using different evaluation metrics
